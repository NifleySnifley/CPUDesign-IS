# RISC-V CPU Design Independent Study

### Improvements

- [X] Add SRAM support as a bus device for stack memory

- [ ] Pipelining (**eek**)

- [ ] Caching & programs from external memory

- [ ] Compressed instruction decoding & support

### Features:

- [X] Test VGA peripheral (black & white text mode) graphics adapter

- [ ] Multicore? (A extension & other stuff)

- [X] M extension

- [ ] B extension

- [ ] CSRs (or traps for system instructions)

- [ ] Interrupt support (learn more about the ISA in this aspect)

- [X] GPIO periperal

- [ ] SPI / PWM / I2C, other peripherals, GPIO muxing!
