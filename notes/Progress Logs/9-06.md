- Found a great simulator for [[Resources]]: https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes
	- A really comprehensive simulation!
- Used the "official" (ish) RISC-V assembly tests for comprehensive testing of the simulator
	- Automated test generation & loading of assembled binaries
	- Fixed `sra` and `sltX` instructions
	- All 40 tests now pass!
