Finished the simulator (pretty much)
- Added a nice CLI interface
- Tested a couple of things (factorial program)
- Interactive breakpoints (memdump, inspect registers)
- Added some debug hooks for future use as a integrated simulator with the testbenches
Excited to start implementing the CPU parts!
- I think "unit tests" (cocotb testbenches) for each instruction would be nice, easy to add test cases and confirm behavior
- Make helpers for running until one instruction has executed (input, clock until PC changes?)
